The following are instructions for generating a ROM using modSTREAmS and DMDc scripts:

Place the output folder from a DMDc run inside a directory (e.g. named DMDc), along with main.py, DMDcFunctions.py, DMDcAnimation.py, and view_slice.py.

If the following in main.py need adjustment, do so.
    # Define paths to the FOM span_averages.H5 file and the corresponding actuation values, as well as the interval between writing the span-averaged data
    span_avg = '/home/nate/Desktop/DMDc_uvw/output/distribute_save/span_averages.h5'
    traj     = '/home/nate/Desktop/DMDc_uvw/output/distribute_save/trajectories.h5'
    SA_int = 5 # Note: Inverval can be found under "config" section of justfile

Run main.py 





The following are instructions for analyzing the ROM using modSTREAmS and DMDcAnalysis scripts:

Place the output folder from a FOM run for which you would like to compare to ROM results using identical actuation values into a directory (e.g. named DMDcAnalysis). Also make sure ROManalysis.py and AnalysisFunctions.py are present in that same directory. Additionally, move the "ReducedModels" folder to the directory, as well as A_red_matrix.npy, B_red_matrix.npy, and DMDcBasis.npy.

If the following in ROManalysis.py need adjustment, do so.
    # Define paths to the FOM span_averages.H5 file and the corresponding actuation values, as well as the interval between writing the span-averaged data
    span_avg = '/home/nate/Desktop/DMDc_uvw/output/distribute_save/span_averages.h5'
    traj     = '/home/nate/Desktop/DMDc_uvw/output/distribute_save/trajectories.h5'
    SA_int = 5 # Note: Inverval can be found under "config" section of justfile
    ...
    compError = [0] # comps = [0,1,2] correspond to U, V, W in the 2D RSE 

Run ROManalysis.py
